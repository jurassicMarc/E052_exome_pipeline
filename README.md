# E052_exome_pipeline
A whole exome somatic variant calling pipeline.

This project was a collaboration between the labs of Trevor Dale (Cardiff University) and Wales Gene Park (c.2018-2020). In this project, there were 10 organoids derived from primary colorectal cancers, matched with 10 germline blood samples. A somatic variant calling pipeline was used to generate call sets for the 10 somatic (organoid) samples. A custom perl script was used to filter the resulting call sets for ~1605 genes of interest.

The pipeline employed commonly used software, including BWA, SAMtools, GATK and VEP.
